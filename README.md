- THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
- THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a timeblock
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist
